# Write a function, shortest_path, that takes in a list of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (node_A, node_B). The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.

def shortest_path(edges, node_A, node_B):
  pass # todo

edges = [
  ['w', 'x'],
  ['x', 'y'],
  ['z', 'y'],
  ['z', 'v'],
  ['w', 'v']
]

shortest_path(edges, 'w', 'z') # -> 2
