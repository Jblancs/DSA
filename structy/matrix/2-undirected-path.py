# Write a function, undirected_path, that takes in a list of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (node_A, node_B). The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a path between node_A and node_B.

def undirected_path(edges, node_A, node_B):
  pass # todo

edges = [
  ('i', 'j'),
  ('k', 'i'),
  ('m', 'k'),
  ('k', 'l'),
  ('o', 'n')
]

undirected_path(edges, 'j', 'm') # -> True
