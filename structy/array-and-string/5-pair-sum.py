# Write a function, pair_sum, that takes in a list and a target sum as arguments. The function should return a tuple containing a pair of indices whose elements sum to the given target. The indices returned must be unique.

# Be sure to return the indices, not the elements themselves.

# There is guaranteed to be one such pair that sums to the target.

def pair_sum(numbers, target_sum):
    pass

pair_sum([3, 2, 5, 4, 1], 8) # -> (0, 2)
