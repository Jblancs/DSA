# Write a function, most_frequent_char, that takes in a string as an argument. The function should return the most frequent character of the string. If there are ties, return the character that appears earlier in the string.

# You can assume that the input string is non-empty.

def most_frequent_char(s):
    pass

most_frequent_char('bookeeper') # -> 'e'
