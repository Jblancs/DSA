# Write a function, five_sort, that takes in a list of numbers as an argument. The function should rearrange elements of the list such that all 5s appear at the end. Your function should perform this operation in-place by mutating the original list. The function should return the list.

# Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the output, as long as all 5s are at the end of the list.

def five_sort(nums):
    pass

print(five_sort([12, 5, 1, 5, 12, 7]))
# -> [12, 7, 1, 12, 5, 5]
