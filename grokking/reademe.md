### Course Structure

Each of the 26 patterns in this course have been used to solve around 5 problems each, allowing you to understand the core of the technique and to experiment with its application to related problems.

The problems within each pattern are organized as follows:

- Category A problems feature step-by-step solution construction so you may understand when, why, and how we design each logical building block of the solution.
- Category B problems showcase a deep dive into the solution, explaining every step in detail.
- Category C problems offer a brief overview of the solution, as well as the coded solution itself. Having guided you through three or four problems in this pattern already, this is where we start to take the training wheels off, while providing just enough support to help you analyze and understand the solution.
- Category D problems are designed to test your skill in applying the techniques in that pattern to solve a new problem. Help is now limited to clues and tips in order to spur your creativity.
- Lastly, the Challenge Yourself chapter features a set of advanced interview questions commonly asked by the top tech companies.

Each problem in the course is presented as a pair of lessons. The first lesson presents the problem statement and the second presents its recommended solution. This is true for all except Category D problems and those listed in the Challenge Yourself chapter.
