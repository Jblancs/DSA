# Hash Maps

Hash map pattern is a method to store data that **reduces time taken to find and access values**

**Hash maps have O(1) LOOKUP time and INSERT time.**

Can be used for problems:
- Two Sum - check for pair in array with target sum

## Does my problem match this pattern?

Yes if:
- We require fast access to data during execution of algo
- We need to store the relationship between two sets of data in order to compute the required result

No, if no useful relation can be established between two sets of data

## Realy world problems
- **Telecommunications:** implement phone book with name of person and number
- **E-commerice:** Search for details of product using id
- **File System:** When user interacts with file system, they see file name and path
